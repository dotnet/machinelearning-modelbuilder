### Text Classification Scenario
Text Classification is now available in Model Builder! Text classification is the process of applying labels or categories to text. This scenario works English text and is great for tasks like sentiment analysis and text categorization. Read the ML.NET announcement  [blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-ml-dotnet-text-classification-api-preview/) post for more details. 

### Advanced Training Options 
Add Advanced Training Options to the Model Builder UI. This allows selection of an optimization metric for the chosen scenario, and any algorithms to exclude from training. [#2191](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2191)

### General
- Save data file as relative path in the .mbconfig file. This allows checking a .mbconfig file and data file into GitHub to be shared across computers. [#1656](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1656)
- Advanced Data Options - Column Settings for Forecasting scenario should be turned off. [#2015](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2015)
- Add command to reload image data and regenerate image training data. This allows users to modify image data and re-train successfully. [#2046](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2046)
- Fix DateTime type support for Forecasting scenario and Evaluate page. [#2166](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2166)
- Show working warning message when there is only one image per label for Image Classification scenario. [#2256](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2256)
- Remove Notebook generation option from Consume page.[#2277](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2277)

### Azure 
- Update Azure ML Compute support to the new [NCv3 series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series) and [NCasT4_v3 series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series).  Existing configurations with `STANDARD_NC6`, `STANDARD_NC12`, `STANDARD_NC24`, `STANDARD_NC24R` will continue to work until Azure discontinues their support. [#1702](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1702)
- Fix authentication when targeting non-Global Azure clouds (e.g. Azure US Government, Azure China, Azure German). [#2134](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2134)

### SQL Improvements 
- Add sample code for loading data from SQL in the generated Console App project. 
- Escape column names in the generated query string used by Model Builder. [#2070](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2070)
- Correctly ignore columns specified in column settings. [#1504](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1504)

### Known Issues
- For some builds of Visual Studio after 17.3.0, it is unclear if Image Classification on GPU is running. No display output is shown [#2343](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2343) **To work around this problem, please run `set TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=3` from a developer command prompt.**
