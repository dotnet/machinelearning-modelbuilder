### Improve consumption code 
_Need to get more details from Zewditu here._ [#1605](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1605) [#1567](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1567) [#1419](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1419)

### Usability 
- Update to MLNet 1.6.0. ARM devices are now supported. [#1658](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1658)
- Fix SQL Server Authentication (SQL username and password) [#1540](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1540)
- Fix new Azure ML Workspace create experience. Users creating their first ML Workspace ran into a blocking key vault bug. This is now fixed. [#1104](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1104), [#1492](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1492), [#1654](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1654)
- Multiple installed version of CUDA do not block GPU training. Only requirment is Cuda 10.1 is installed and Cuda_Path_v10_1 is set. [#1642](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1642)
- Binary classification used when specified. Set label column type to "boolean" in the Advanced Data Options to use binary classification. [#1211](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1211)

### Performance 
- Better AutoML. Improve CFO turner and implement random start. [#1505](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1505)
- Improve memory efficiency in data pre-processing: Fix Array dimensions exceeded supported range [#1561](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1561), Parsing failed with an exception: Stream reading encountered exception [#1583](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1583)

### UI fixes
- Replace Image Classification folder picker with file picker filtered to folders. [#394](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/394)
- Improved usability of Advanced Data Options. Increase size of the name column and add tooltip for long names. [#1534](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1534)
- Rename confusing "Text classification" to "Data classification" [#1710](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1710)

### Other fixes
- Progress is not reset if the Scenario card is re-clicked from the Scenario tab. [#1387](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1387)
- `Value cannot be null` error on data source type change [#1528](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1528)
- Fix Train tab shows lowest accuracy run on reload [#1663](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1663)
